üß† Project Overview: AI Image Generation to Instagram Workflow
üîó Goal:
Build a web-based system where a user can:

Enter a text prompt.

Generate an AI image.

Edit the image in-browser.

Frontend Tasks:

Send the prompt to backend or API for image generation

Allow image editing in the browser

After editing, send the final image and caption to the backend via HTTP POST

2. Image Generation
Options:
